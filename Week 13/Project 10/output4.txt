    Cells:       Cells are numbered 1 through 4. They can hold a
                 single card each.

    Foundations: Foundations are numbered 1 through 4. They are
                 built up by rank from Ace to King for each suit.
                 All cards must be in the foundations to win.

    Tableaus:    Tableaus are numbered 1 through 8. They are dealt
                 to at the start of the game from left to right
                 until all cards are dealt. Cards can be moved one
                 at a time from tableaus to cells, foundations, or
                 other tableaus. Tableaus are built down by rank
                 and cards must be of the same suit.
